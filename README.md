# SummerGameDesign 2022 <br>
<h1>Hello, this was a class game made during a summer pilot game design course (2022)</h1>
<h2>UPDATE</h2>
<h4>Game project file was too large even for GIT LFS, so only the scripts I wrote will be included in the final commit</h4>
<h2>About the game</h2>
<hr>
<p>The game was a class project and the first of its kind at my school. In 3 weeks we had to design a game with the help of our coding teacher, Mr. Rowell, who already provided some core logic pre-implemented into the game such as a singleton and a moveable character. The game quickly increased in scope and complexity, with the final result consisting of 4 levels, each developed by a seperate group in the class. The game takes place in a fantasy world, where the objective is to reach the end of this linear world and defeat the final boss.</p>
<h2>Here are my contributions towards the game</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li><b>Magic and Melee Combat System</b>
  <p>Created the weapon attacks and magic attacks using precise IEnumerators and timing logic to give it a realistic feel.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Leveling System and Talent System</b>
  <p>Along with a handful of others, brainstormed and implemented the logic for creating unlockable power-ups and custom stat modifications.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Final Level Enemy State Machines</b>
  <p>For the last level consisting of a sky island and a ruined void castle, created the state machines necessary for the mimic and beholder enemies to switch between animation states. In addition, also produced the final boss at the end of the game in a similar way using a finite state machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Final Level All Coding Events</b>
  <p>All the custom coding logic unique to the sky island and ruined void castle, including the matrix light up puzzle and the artifact event logic.</p>
  </li>
  </li>
  <li><b>Core Logic Code</b>
  <p>Core logic code developed for use for all groups, including scripts for mouse pick up and custom object movement.</p>
  </li>
