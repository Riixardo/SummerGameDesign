# SummerGameDesign 2022 <br>
<h1>Hello, this was a class game made during a summer pilot game design course (2022)</h1>
<h2>Here are my contributions towards the game</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li><b>Magic and Melee Combat System</b>
  <p>Created the weapon attacks and magic attacks using precise IEnumerators and timing logic to give it a realistic feel.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Leveling System and Talent System</b>
  <p>Along with a handful of others, brainstormed and implemented the logic for creating unlockable power-ups and custom stat modifications.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Final Level Enemy State Machines</b>
  <p>For the last level consisting of a sky island and a ruined void castle, created the state machines necessary for the mimic and beholder enemies to switch between animation states. In addition, also produced the final boss at the end of the game in a similar way using a finite state machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Final Level All Coding Events</b>
  <p>All the custom coding logic unique to the sky island and ruined void castle, including the matrix light up puzzle and the artifact event logic.</p>
  </li>
  </li>
  <li><b>Core Logic Code</b>
  <p>Core logic code developed for use for all groups, including scripts for mouse pick up and custom object movement.</p>
  </li>
