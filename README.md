# SummerGameDesign 2022 <br>
<h1>Hello, this was a class game made during a summer pilot game design course (2022)</h1>
<h2>Here are my contributions towards the game</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li><b>Magic and Melee Combat System</b>
  <p>I created the weapon attacks and magic attacks using precise IEnumerators and timing logic to give it a fantasical feel.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Leveling System and Talent System</b>
  <p>Along with a handful of others, brainstormed and implemented the logic for creating unlockable power-ups and custom stat modifications.</p>
  </li>
